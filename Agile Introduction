Agile:
Roles and Responsibilities: 
In Agile, there are various roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team members.
The Product Owner is responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog.
The Scrum Master ensures that the Agile principles and processes are followed, while the Development Team is responsible for delivering the product increment.

Process:
Agile is a flexible and iterative approach to software development. It emphasizes customer collaboration, responding to change, and delivering working software in short iterations. 
It involves continuously adapting to evolving requirements.

Scrum:

Roles and Responsibilities:
In Scrum, there are three primary roles - Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team. 
The Product Owner manages the product backlog, the Scrum Master facilitates the Scrum process, and the Development Team is responsible for delivering increments of the product.
Process: Scrum is a specific Agile framework that operates in time-boxed iterations known as sprints. 
It involves daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning, sprint review, and sprint retrospective. Scrum aims to deliver a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint.

Kanban:
Roles and Responsibilities: Kanban is less prescriptive about roles. It can be applied to various teams and doesn't define specific roles like Scrum does.
However, there is typically a Kanban system manager or coordinator responsible for the flow of work on the board.
Process: Kanban is a visual process management method that focuses on flow and limiting work in progress (WIP).
Work items are represented on a Kanban board, and the process is driven by demand. When one task is completed, the team can pull the next one from the backlog, aiming for a continuous flow of work.
In summary, Agile is a broader philosophy, while Scrum and Kanban are specific frameworks within the Agile approach. 
Scrum is characterized by defined roles, ceremonies, and fixed time-boxed iterations, while Kanban offers more flexibility with roles and emphasizes flow and WIP limits. 
The choice between Scrum and Kanban depends on the specific needs and constraints of your project.
